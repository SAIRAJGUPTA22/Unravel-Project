# Unravel Project

This project is a Python based news aggregation pipeline that collects, parses, and stores the latest articles from two leading travel industry news sources: **Skift** and **PhocusWire**. Its primary goal is to maintain an up-to-date, deduplicated repository of travel news for streamlined access and analysis.

## 1. Data Sources

- **Skift:** Provides structured metadata, including reliable published dates in ISO format.
- **PhocusWire:** Lacks consistent published dates on homepage articles, necessitating fallback handling.

## 2. Extraction Process

The scraper retrieves the homepages of both sources and extracts the following details for each article:

- **Title**
- **URL**
- **Summary** (when available)
- **Published Date**
- **Unique Article ID**: Generated as an MD5 hash of the URL and title.

**Source-Specific Handling:**

- **Skift:** Published dates are extracted from `<time>` tags in ISO format.
- **PhocusWire:** Due to the absence of published dates on the homepage, the current UTC time is used as a fallback.

## 3. Database Management

- Utilizes an **SQLite database** to store article details and published timestamps.
- Ensures **no duplicate entries** by checking unique article IDs before insertion.
- Maintains synchronization metadata to support incremental updates.

## 4. Incremental Updates

- On subsequent runs, the pipeline processes **only new articles** by comparing their published dates against the last synchronization time.
- **Skift:** Supports effective incremental syncing due to reliable published dates.
- **PhocusWire:** All homepage articles are treated as new on each run because of unreliable published dates, leading to repeated processing.

## 5. Handling PhocusWire Limitations

- The lack of real published dates on PhocusWire's homepage prevents reliable incremental filtering.
- As a result, every homepage article from PhocusWire is reprocessed during each run.
- Future enhancements may include scraping individual article pages to extract accurate published dates or leveraging alternative metadata if available.

## 6. Pipeline Execution and Logging

**Execution Steps:**

- Fetch articles from both Skift and PhocusWire.
- Filter out duplicates within the same run.
- Perform incremental synchronization based on published dates for Skift articles.

**Logging:**

- Duplicate detections are logged **exclusively** in `logs/duplicates.log` to maintain a clean main console.
- The main log file (`news_pipeline.log`) records all pipeline activities and errors.
- Console output displays:
  - Number of articles fetched per source.
  - Number of new articles inserted.
  - Details of the latest 5 articles.

## 7. Scheduling
- The pipeline can be executed manually or scheduled to run hourly.
- Manual Run:
    python main.py
- Scheduled Run (Every Hour):
    python main.py --schedule
- When scheduled, the script remains active, executing scraping jobs automatically to ensure the news database stays current throughout the day.

## Duplicate Checks — How They Are Performed

### In-Memory Duplicate Detection (Within a Single Run):

- The pipeline uses an **in-memory set** (usually named `all_ids` or `seen_ids`) to keep track of every article ID processed in the **current execution**.
- Each article has a **unique ID generated by hashing its URL and title**.
- If an article ID already exists in this set during the run, the article is considered a duplicate **within the same run** and is **skipped**, preventing repeated inserts of the same article arriving multiple times.
- These duplicate detections are logged to a **separate file (`logs/duplicates.log`)** to avoid cluttering the console and main logs.

### Database-Level Duplicate Prevention:

- Before inserting an article, the pipeline checks the **last synchronization time** of that source.
- Articles that are **older or equal to the last sync timestamp** are **skipped** because they were already processed in a previous run.
- The insertion function ensures that articles with the same unique ID do not create multiple records in the database.

## Handling Article Updates (Optional Enhancement)

Currently, the pipeline **does not update existing articles** — it only inserts new ones and skips duplicates. However, if we want to handle **updates to articles** (for example, if titles, summaries, or other metadata change over time), we can follow this suggested approach:

### Proposed Process to Handle Article Updates

 **Add a New Column to  Articles Table**

   - Create a column, e.g., called `content_hash` or `checksum`, which stores a hash or checksum representing the current state of the article's content (title, summary, author, or any relevant fields).

 **During Each Pipeline Run:**

   - For each article fetched, compute the hash/checksum of the *important* fields we want to track for changes (e.g., title + summary + published date).
   - Query the database to check if the article already exists:
     - If the article **does not exist**, insert it normally.
     - If the article **exists**, compare the new checksum with the stored one.
       - If the checksums are **equal**, it means nothing changed — skip updating.
       - If the checksums differ, update the article in the database with the new values and update the checksum column.
